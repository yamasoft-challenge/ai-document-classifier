# Task Challenge: AI Document Classifier with Web Interface
Thanks for applying for this role at Yamasoft. We've put together this code challenge. It should take around four hours to complete, do not invest more time.

## Context:
You are working on an AI platform that helps enterprises automatically classify and summarize documents (e.g., contracts, research papers, or receipts) based on their content. Your task is to create a prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of this platform.
## Requirements:

**1. Machine Learning (Core Task)**
* Implement a simple ML pipeline to classify documents (text-based).
* Use a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., `Hugging Face`, `spaCy`, or `scikit-learn`).
* The categories for classification should include at least:
  * `Legal Document`
  * `Research Paper`
  * `Receipt`
* You can use simple embeddings like `TF-IDF` if transformer models are too heavy.
* Implement a basic function to summarize the key sections of the document.

**2. Backend Development (Required)**
* Build a REST API using Python (`Flask` or `FastAPI`) with the following endpoints:

   - `/classify`: Accepts a text document and returns the classification.
   - `/summarize`: Accepts a text document and returns a brief summary.
   - `/health-check`: Returns the health status of the service.

* Include proper error handling and response formats (e.g., JSON).

**3. Frontend Development (Optional)**
* If you choose to implement a front-end, create a simple web interface using any framework (React, Vue, or even plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
  * Upload a text file or paste text into a text area.
  * A button to classify the document and another to summarize it.
  * Display the classification result and summary in a clean format.
    
**4. Deployment (Optional)**
* Provide a `Dockerfile` to containerize your application.
* Instructions for running the service locally using `Docker`.

---
## Deliverables:

* Source code with clear structure, comments and commits in a public GitHub repository.
* `README.md` with instructions for running the API locally and testing endpoints.
* Any notes explaining assumptions, limitations, and future improvements.

---
## Evaluation Criteria:

**1. ML Expertise:**
* Correct implementation of the classification and summarization models.
* Appropriate preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.
* Ability to balance between simplicity and performance (e.g., lightweight vs. heavy models).
  
**2. Backend Development:**
* Clean and modular Python code.
* Proper API design and adherence to REST principles.
* Error handling and robustness.
  
**3. Frontend (if implemented):**
* Intuitive user interface.
* Proper handling of API responses and errors.
* Simple but effective design.
  
**4. Documentation and Maintainability:**
* Clear and concise `README.md`.
* Use of version control (Git).

**5. Extra Credit ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**
* Clear separation of concerns (e.g., `services.py` for ML logic, `app.py` for API routes).
* Innovative additions (e.g., displaying model confidence scores or logs).
